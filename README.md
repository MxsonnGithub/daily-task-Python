# Daily Productivity Tracker

A simple **Daily Productivity Tracker** built with Python and Tkinter. This application allows you to **add tasks, mark them as completed, and generate a daily report** with total time spent on tasks.

## Features
- **Add tasks** with a start time.
- **Mark tasks as completed** with an end time.
- **Generate a daily report** summarizing completed tasks and total time spent.
- **Simple GUI interface** using Tkinter.
- **Persistent storage** using JSON.

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed. This script requires **Tkinter**, which is included with standard Python installations.

## Installing Python
If you donâ€™t have Python installed, follow these steps:
1. Download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer and make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.
3. Verify installation by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:
   ```sh
   python --version
   ```
   or (on some systems)
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MxsonnGithub/daily-task-Python.git
   cd daily-task-Python
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```sh
   pip install tk
   ```
